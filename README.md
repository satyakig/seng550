### Objectives:

Build a big data system that uses statistical analysis and machine learning (ML) to create a hotlist of companies to invest in. Specifically, we are looking to develop a system that uses quantamental analysis to achieve this goal. Quantamental analysis uses the fundamentals of a company along with technical information to better understand the value of a company.
